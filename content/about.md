Welcome to my website! I'm Hugo, an iOS developer from the Netherlands.

In my free time I like to read, play guitar and go for walks. Also, I'm working on a website called [wat kan ik doen](https://watkanikdoen.nl). This site is used to create an overview of upcoming protests in the Netherlands. On top of this I'm building an iOS app for the project to expand my knowledge of app development.

For a while I've been trying to write more. Throughout my day I encounter things that make me think. Usually I forget about it soon, and this has bothered me for a while. This site is my attempt to start writing down more of my thoughts.
