Welcome to my website! 2 of my colleagues started a blog and took up the challenge to write 100 post in a year. This is my attempt to join them in the challenge! :)

For a while I've been trying to write more. Throughout my day I encounter things that make me think. Usually I forget about it soon, and this has bothered me for a while. I want to have a medium where I can write these thoughts down, so this challenge seemed like the perfect opportunity to get started.

Why the name meditations? Meditations is defined as follows: "A written or spoken discourse expressing considered thoughts on a subject."

Mostly I chose it because I like the book by Marcus Aurelius! :)

But also since I would like to use this site to write about my thoughts, and in turn force myself to think about how I want to express my thoughts.
