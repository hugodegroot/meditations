      <description>Welcome to my website! 2 of my colleagues started a blog and took up the challenge to write 100 post in a year. This is my attempt to join them in the challenge! :)
For a while I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to write more. Throughout my day I encounter things that make me think. Usually I forget about it soon, and this has bothered me for a while. I want to have a medium where I can write these thoughts down, so this challenge seemed like the perfect opportunity to get started.</description>
